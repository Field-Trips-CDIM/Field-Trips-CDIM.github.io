<h1>About us</h1>
<p><b>Who we are?</b><br> Hello, and welcome to our website. We are the class 3ºB of E.S.O of Liceo Cónsul’s school, and we are doing a project in technology’s class about a website for ideas for new school field trips. We have created this website, as we said, for a technology’s projet class, but we want to provide information about a topic that in our class we consider unfair compared to other schools. We’re talking about school field trips that we consider an inconvenient for us, because since quarantine we have not had trips as we had before and we consider that they were good for our education. We have chosen this topic for the reasons that are shown above, and once we had it we started creating this page. <br>Here are the creators of this website:
