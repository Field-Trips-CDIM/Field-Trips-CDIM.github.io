<h4>REVIEWS</h4>

<ol>
  <li>CARMINA65: <br>
  Totally recommended for those who want to take a walk through an extensive part of the history of Spain.

I recommend the guided tour, it's 4 euros more, but it's worth it. It lasts 2 hours and is necessary to understand and discover curiosities about the monastery. 
There is a discount on admission for students under 25.
The only thing that the guided tour does not include is the area of ​​the Bourbons.It is a very pleasant excursion with beautiful views of the surroundings. 22/10/2022</li>

  For a few years we have traveled with our high school students and visited Madrid de los Austrias, where El Escorial has a privileged place. They have always treated us very well, the guides and the guides of the monument, the security service, unbeatable. I think it's great and I'm grateful that a place where so many people pass by maintains such good service and great treatment of visitors. 12/10/2022</li>
